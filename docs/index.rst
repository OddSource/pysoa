PySOA Documentation
===================

This directory and its contents contain the entire PySOA documentation. In it, you'll find details about the PySOA
API, creating clients and servers, and testing PySOA servers and service-calling code. It is also recommended that
you read the summary in the `PySOA README file <https://github.com/eventbrite/pysoa/blob/master/README.rst>`_.

Contents

  all critical classes, functions, settings schemas, and other members of the PySOA public API
- `Testing with PySOA <testing.rst>`_ - Detailed instructions for using the several test helpers and utilities provided
  for testing your services and service clients
- `Example Service <https://github.com/eventbrite/example_service>`_ - A complete, functional sample PySOA service,
  including a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ environment for running and testing it, which serves as living
  documentation for how PySOA works and best practices when creating and structuring PySOA services.
- `The PySOA Protocol <protocol.rst>`_ - A detailed explanation of the abstract PySOA protocol, for use when writing
  compatible libraries and products on other platforms
